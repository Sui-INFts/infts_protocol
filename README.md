# **INFT: AI-driven, interactive NFTs with decentralized storage**.

## **Overview**

INFT (Intelligent NFT) is an innovative AI-driven NFT framework that enhances traditional NFTs by integrating **evolving intelligence, user interaction, and decentralized storage**. Unlike static NFTs that offer limited engagement beyond ownership and trading, INFTs adapt and grow based on user interactions, increasing their long-term value and utility.

By leveraging **Walrus** for cost-effective and decentralized storage on the **Sui blockchain**, INFTs provide a scalable and resilient infrastructure for digital assets that evolve dynamically over time. This project aims to create an **AI-powered NFT marketplace** where creators, collectors, and businesses can interact with intelligent NFTs, unlocking new opportunities for engagement, monetization, and utility.

## **Problem Statement**

### **Challenges with Traditional NFTs**

1. **Static Nature:** NFTs remain unchanged after minting, offering no dynamic utility.
2. **Limited Engagement:** Users have no incentive to interact beyond buying and selling.
3. **Monetization Issues:** Creators only earn from the initial sale and limited royalties.
4. **Lack of Scalability:** Many NFTs rely on costly, inefficient storage solutions.
5. **Underutilized AI Potential:** No direct AI-driven mechanisms exist to enhance NFTs.

## **Solution: INFT Framework**

INFT introduces **AI-powered, evolving NFTs** that grow in intelligence and value through user interactions. This is achieved through:

- **AI-Driven Learning**: INFTs adapt to interactions, enhancing engagement and utility.
- **Storage-Linked Value**: NFTs evolve based on a **storage count**, allowing owners to train their NFT by purchasing additional storage.
- **Dynamic Metadata Updates**: INFTs continuously update their metadata to reflect growth, ensuring long-term engagement.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Powered by **Walrus**, ensuring secure and verifiable metadata management.
- **Creator Royalties & Sustainable Monetization**: A dynamic royalty model rewards past owners based on their contributions to an NFT's evolution.

## **Key Features**

### **1. AI-Driven Interaction**

- INFTs respond and evolve based on user inputs and interactions.
- Learning models enable INFTs to offer tailored responses, insights, and creative outputs.

### **2. Interaction Count & Evolution Mechanism**

- Each INFT tracks its **Interaction Count**, which determines its growth and value.
- Owners can **purchase Interaction Tokens** to enhance NFT intelligence.
- NFTs evolve into higher-tier versions based on user engagement and data inputs.

### **3. Interaction Tokens (Request Quotes)**

- Utility tokens that enable NFT training and advanced interactions.
- Provide a **continuous revenue stream** by driving user engagement.

### **4. Dynamic Royalties & Incentives**

- Previous owners earn a percentage of future sales, determined by an NFT’s **Interaction Score**.
- Encourages long-term value creation and shared ecosystem growth.

### **5. INFT Marketplace**

- Central hub for buying, selling, and trading INFTs.
- Highlights an NFT’s **Interaction Score, evolution history, and unique attributes**.
- Integrated with **Sui blockchain** for seamless transactions.
